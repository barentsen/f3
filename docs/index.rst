f3 Photometry for Keplerâ€™s Full Frame Images
============================================

f3 is a package for doing photometry with Kepler's Full Frame Images, a set of calibration data 
obtained approximately monthly during the primary Kepler mission. While the main mission targeted
about 200,000 stars at 30-minute cadence, there are a total of 4.5 million objects in the Kepler
field that fall in the telescope's field of view but are only accessible through the FFIs.

Our original work with the FFIs can be found at arXiv:1608.01316, while this code is presented
in arXiv:1705.07928.
