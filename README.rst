f3
===

**Full Frame Fotometry package for interacting with and measuring photometry
for targets observed in the Kepler Full Frame Images**

Installation
------------

Start by installing the dependencies:

1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. scipy
3. pyfits (I know)
4. kplr (https://github.com/dfm/kplr)
5. mahotas 

Running “pip install f3” or cloning this repository and running setup.py should then
enable you to run the code.


Get the data
------------

To download the Kepler full frame images, run::

    wget -r -nH -nd -np -R index.html -e robots=off https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/kepler/ffi/

Note: this is 44gb worth of data!

f3 will look for this in the “ffidata” subdirectory inside your working directory, but
this can be changed in an argument when you initialize your object.



Use the code
----------------

There is a jupyter notebook in this directory which provides an example use case for this package.


Cite the code
----------------

Please cite `Montet, Tovar, and Foreman-Mackey (to be submitted) if you find this code
useful in your research. If it is after May 18, this code is available on the arXiv and we’ll put a link here when that is true.
